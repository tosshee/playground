Creating a state transition table is a structured way to represent how the state of a system changes in response to events or conditions. For the elevator system we discussed, this table will list the current states, possible events, and the resulting next states, providing a clear and concise view of the system's logic.

Here's the state transition table for the two-floor elevator system:

### State Transition Table for Elevator System

| Current State             | Event                                 | Next State             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Idle at First Floor       | External Up Pressed at First Floor    | Open at First Floor    |
| Idle at First Floor       | External Up Pressed at Second Floor   | Moving Up              |
| Open at First Floor       | Internal Close Pressed                | Idle at First Floor    |
| Open at First Floor       | Internal 2nd Floor Button Pressed     | Moving Up              |
| Moving Up                 | Arrive 2nd Floor                      | Open at Second Floor   |
| Idle at Second Floor      | External Down Pressed at Second Floor | Open at Second Floor   |
| Idle at Second Floor      | External Down Pressed at First Floor  | Moving Down            |
| Open at Second Floor      | Internal Close Pressed                | Idle at Second Floor   |
| Open at Second Floor      | Internal 1st Floor Button Pressed     | Moving Down            |
| Moving Down               | Arrive 1st Floor                      | Open at First Floor    |

### Description of Table Columns:

- **Current State**: The state the elevator is in before an event occurs.
- **Event**: A trigger or condition that causes a transition from one state to another.
- **Next State**: The state the elevator transitions to as a result of the event.

This table serves as a quick reference for understanding how the elevator reacts to different user interactions and system conditions. Each row represents a complete cycle of a condition (event) leading to a change in state. It's particularly useful for programming the control logic of the elevator or for troubleshooting issues by tracking the sequence of state changes. If you have any modifications, additional scenarios, or other aspects to incorporate, please let me know!
