Certainly! To enhance user feedback, let's modify the code so that it informs the user when a transition is not allowed based on the current state and the chosen event. This will make the simulation more informative and realistic.

### Updated Python Code with Error Handling for Disallowed Transitions

Here is the Python script updated to handle and inform about disallowed transitions:

```python
class ElevatorState:
    def enter_state(self):
        print(self.__class__.__name__)

    def handle_event(self, event):
        print("That transition is NOT allowed.")
        return self  # Returns self to remain in the current state

class IdleAtFirstFloor(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "1":
            return OpenAtFirstFloor()
        elif event == "2":
            return MovingUp()
        return super().handle_event(event)  # Call the base method for disallowed transitions

class IdleAtSecondFloor(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "3":
            return OpenAtSecondFloor()
        elif event == "4":
            return MovingDown()
        return super().handle_event(event)

class OpenAtFirstFloor(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "5":
            return IdleAtFirstFloor()
        elif event == "6":
            return MovingUp()
        return super().handle_event(event)

class OpenAtSecondFloor(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "7":
            return IdleAtSecondFloor()
        elif event == "8":
            return MovingDown()
        return super().handle_event(event)

class MovingUp(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "9":
            return OpenAtSecondFloor()
        return super().handle_event(event)

class MovingDown(ElevatorState):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == "10":
            return OpenAtFirstFloor()
        return super().handle_event(event)

class ElevatorContext:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.current_state = initial_state
        self.current_state.enter_state()

    def trigger_event(self, event):
        new_state = self.current_state.handle_event(event)
        if new_state != self.current_state:
            self.current_state = new_state
            self.current_state.enter_state()

def main():
    context = ElevatorContext(IdleAtFirstFloor())
    while True:
        print("\n1. External Up at First Floor (Open Doors)")
        print("2. External Up at Second Floor (Move Up)")
        print("3. External Down at Second Floor (Open Doors)")
        print("4. External Down at First Floor (Move Down)")
        print("5. Close Doors at First Floor")
        print("6. Go to Second Floor from First Floor")
        print("7. Close Doors at Second Floor")
        print("8. Go to First Floor from Second Floor")
        print("9. Arrive at Second Floor")
        print("10. Arrive at First Floor")
        print("0. Exit")
        event = input("Enter choice: ")
        if event == "0":
            print("Exiting elevator simulation.")
            break
        context.trigger_event(event)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Changes Made:

- **Base Class Method for Handling Events**: The `handle_event` method in the `ElevatorState` base class now prints an error message for disallowed transitions. This method will be called if a derived class does not handle a specific event.
- **Superclass Call for Disallowed Transitions**: In each state class, if the event does not match any allowed transitions, the method from the base class (`super().handle_event(event)`) is called, which handles the error message printing.

This approach ensures that every time an invalid or disallowed event is triggered, the user receives immediate feedback, enhancing the usability and robustness of the elevator simulation. If you need additional features or modifications, feel free to ask!
